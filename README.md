This repo was tested on Raspberry pi 3B+ as a computer for student.

### Ros setup
Follow this instruction http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi 


Note: To avoid the memory exhaustion problem on Raspberry pi 3B+, you should [increase swap memory](https://nebl.io/neblio-university/enabling-increasing-raspberry-pi-swap/) before catkin_make. <br>I set it to 1024M.
